<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: we are building an app called rapid response team to help animal welfare volunteers. it has to be PWA. will share screen by screen, need your help to develop it. 1st screen is at attached. create ditto from looks POV.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive frontend prototype for a PWA named Rapid Response Team. It features a full user authentication and onboarding flow: Login (phone), OTP, Profile Setup, and Success screens. Post-login, there is a Dashboard with a press and hold SOS feature, which leads to an SOS Active screen with a countdown and an Add Proof flow. The app includes a bottom navigation bar for accessing the Dashboard (Home), a Community screen listing local volunteers, and an SOS Alerts screen with tabs for CURRENT, PAST, and MY ALERTS. A fully functional, mock-data-driven Chat screen is accessible from the Community and SOS Alerts sections. All screens are designed to be responsive and follow a consistent dark-themed design system.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Implementing the Notifications Screen. The agent created the file , added the route in , and updated the  handlers for the notification bell icon on various screens to navigate to . The implementation of the UI itself has not started.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: A user-reported bug where the app was stuck after OTP validation. The agent claims to have fixed this, but the user was extremely frustrated. This needs immediate verification. (PRIORITY: P0)
-   Issue 2: The UI and functionality for the Notifications screen are not implemented yet. (PRIORITY: P1)

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1**:
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent ensured the  function in  correctly uses , checked  for correct routing, and restarted the server. Screenshots were provided to the user as proof of the fix.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Run the full authentication flow from a fresh browser session (incognito mode) to rule out caching.
        2.  Verify the URL correctly changes from  to  after successful OTP submission.
        3.  Confirm the OTP verified successfully! toast appears on the  screen.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This was a major point of user frustration and credit usage complaints. Verifying the fix is critical to restore user confidence and ensure the core onboarding flow works reliably.
    - **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- **Issue 2**:
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent created the file  and updated the routing. No UI implementation has been attempted.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Analyze the user-provided images for the notifications screen ( and ).
        2.  Implement the UI in  to replicate the design.
        3.  Use mocked data for the notification list.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the next feature requested by the user. Completing it will add a key piece of functionality accessible from the main app header.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1**: Complete the implementation of the Notifications Screen. (PRIORITY: P0)
    - **Where to resume**: The file  has been created but is empty. The agent needs to build the React component UI based on the two images the user provided for notifications. Routing and navigation links from bell icons have already been partially set up.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A functional notifications page accessible from the bell icon throughout the app, as requested by the user.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
The user provides screens sequentially. The next task will be whatever screen the user provides after the Notifications screen is complete.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React.js
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, custom CSS for animations.
-   **Routing**:  for client-side routing.
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (, , ).
-   **Data**: All data is mocked and hardcoded within the components. No backend is used.

**key DB schema**
-   NA (No database used)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Newly created, empty file for the notifications feature.
-   : Contains the OTP verification logic that was a point of user frustration.
-   : Main router setup for all pages.
-   : Core design system, custom CSS, and animations.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None identified.

**key api endpoints**
-   NA (No backend API calls are made).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user provides requirements screen-by-screen via image uploads and expects pixel-perfect replication.
-   All functionality is mocked on the frontend. Do not attempt to build a backend.
-   There has been significant user frustration regarding a perceived bug in the OTP-to-Profile navigation flow. Even if the flow appears to work, you must re-test it thoroughly in a clean environment (incognito mode) to ensure there are no caching issues and to restore user confidence.
-   Your immediate task is to build the UI for the Notifications screen in  based on the two images the user has provided.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User**:  (with image for SOS Alerts PAST tab) - **DONE**
2.  **User**:  (with image for SOS Alerts MY ALERTS tab) - **DONE**
3.  **User**:  (with image for Chat screen) - **DONE**
4.  **User**:  (with image for Notifications screen) - **IN PROGRESS**
5.  **User**:  (with a second image for Notifications screen) - **PENDING**. This is the current task.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: None.
-   **Mocked**: All functionality is mocked. This includes user authentication, OTP verification, location detection, SOS alerts, chat messaging, and all user data.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (once, for the login screen).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None
-   **Known regressions**: A potential regression in the OTP-to-Profile navigation flow, as reported by the user, needs verification.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   NA

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not yet implemented the UI for the  file. The file was created and routes were updated, but the component itself is empty. This is the next logical step based on the user's last two requests.</analysis>
